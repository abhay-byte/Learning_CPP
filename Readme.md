## Introduction

This repository contains programs that have been assigned as practical assignments. ProgramX includes clean code, while ProgramRefacX consists of shortened code. If you plan to write the program in your practical file, I suggest using ProgramRefacX.

## My Thoughts

I enjoy learning new languages that teach the fundamentals and basics of programming. To achieve that, there is no better language than C/C++. However, I strongly believe that writing these codes on paper in this day and age is both unnecessary and a waste of time.
